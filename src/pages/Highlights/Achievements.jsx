          IEEE Challenge Sphere 2024 has been honored as the Best Sectional
          Project by the IEEE Sri Lanka Section, recognizing its significant
          contribution to empowering undergraduates and school students in
          engineering and technology. As Sri Lankaâ€™s largest national
          competition series of its kind, the initiative bridges gaps in
          national contests, fostering innovation, collaboration, and skill
          development. With five unique challenges and expert mentorship, it
          creates a sustainable ecosystem for future engineers, preparing them
          for global success while advancing technological excellence.
